# merge_csv_columns
This converts a csv files: it merges columns into one, based on specified common words in the column header.

For instance: if the csv has 2 columns (eg: 'red_cars', and 'blue_cars') these could be merged into a result column called (for this example) 'cars'.

It's just a convenience script for processing several largish sparse spreadsheets that have many blank and many (nearly exactly) repeated column headers.
